 ## Analysis Summary  
 1. **Spending vs. Performance:** Schools with higher per-student spending tend to have higher average math and reading scores, as well as higher overall passing rates. This suggests that investing more resources on a per-student basis can positively influence academic outcomes.  
 2. **Impact of School Size:** Smaller schools often show better performance metrics compared to larger schools, possibly due to lower student-to-teacher ratios that allow for more personalized instruction and support.
